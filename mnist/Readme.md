Different gamma values were passed and optimized gamma values was selected by testing on validation accuracy.

With optimized gamma  training ,validation and test accuracies were calculated.

We find that after 0.01 values of validation accuracy starts decreasing leading to overfitting of model.

So best optimized value is selcted as 0.01.
